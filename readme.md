# Sidebar Tools

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braver/SideBarTools/master/screenshot.png" width="336">

A small set of useful tools to add to your sidebar context menu and command palette:

- [x] copy filename
- [x] copy full file path
- [x] copy relative file path
- [x] duplicate
- [x] reveal in sidebar
- [x] open in default program

This package offers a tiny optimised subset of commands from the original [SidebarEnhancements](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarEnhancements), striking a balance somwhere between the default set and the kitchen sink.

- The default set of actions isn't touched, this package just adds some useful new commands.
- It's tiny.
- We won't [track](https://github.com/SideBarEnhancements-org/SideBarEnhancements/blob/d1c7fa4bac6a1f31ba177bc41ddd0ca902e43609/Stats.py) you. Ever.
